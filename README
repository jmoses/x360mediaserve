x360mediaserve is a Java based UPnP media server that's main purpose is to send 
media files to a network attached Xbox360.

== Origins 

The project was started by Thomas Walker, and forked to Github (from r31) on
2009-04-01 by Jon Moses (jon@burningbush.us) since it doesn't seem to be under
active development anymore.

== Running

Download the latest release from http://github.com/jmoses/x360mediaserve/tree/master

Under 'all tags', click the highest version "rel" tag and download.

Extract the archive.

Run the server with:

  java -jar x360mediaserve-release.jar
  
If you want to use a different IP from the one the server picks, supply it as an argument
like:

  java -jar x360mediaserve-release.jar x.x.x.x

The server will default to serving media from the directory you start it in, but you can 
configure that.
  
== Configuring

Point a web browser at http://[ip address here]:7000/configure

This currently works best from the same machine the server is running on.

At least fill in a "Music Dir", and maybe a "Friendly Name".

The "Music Dir" is the directory to scan for audio files, and the "Friendly Name" is
what will show up on your Xbox360.

The "Video Dir" is the directory to scan for video files.  This actually works,
at this point, although there are some rough edges I think.

== Common Issues

The service won't run if Windows Media Connect is running on the same machine.

I don't think that transcoding works properly, although I could be wrong, since I
haven't tried it at all.  If it _doesn't_ work, you won't be able to play any media
files that the Xbox360 can't handle natively.

If it _does_ work, let me know.
