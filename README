----------

If you are running Windows media connect then disable it and disconnect it from the xbox via the xbox options.

To configure point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:7000/conf.html I suggest to test it you only point it at a small number such as a single album

-----------

If the 360 can't detect it there's a good chance its caused by the Firewall blocking it. Try disabling the firewall or giving java permission to act as a server on the local network.

If you get errors about could not open socket try adding the ip after the start script e.g ./start 192.168.0.1

If you get silence try running the relavent conversion script from a terminal

If you get static on the 360 there's a good chance its caused by the endianness of the output from the relevant script being wrong. Try adding/removing the -x flag from lame
